## Weekly Report 2


### What have I done this week?

Been working on the program itself, creating mostly necessary data structures.

### How program has progressed?

Created classes for Trie data structure and for nodes of Trie. Test coverage for Trie is 100%, which is nice.

### What have I learned this week?

I've learned properly how Markov chains and Trie works together. For some reason implementation with matrixes
made more sense to me but this week I learned why Trie is the way to go. Pretty handy tool if you ask me. 

### What was left unclear?

How rhythm and melody creation goes hand in hand exactly. I know the basic idea is the same, but details are 
still a bit hazy. The format of input and output is still bit of a mystery but at the moment I'm using some
made up notation system which covers three octaves and each number represents one note (0-35). When I know
which format I want to use I need to do some minor refactoring.

### What next?

Start working on the generator itself. I'm going to make it functional with this simplified notation system
and when it's done I'll decide if I'm going to use LilyPond or MIDI files as input and output format.
