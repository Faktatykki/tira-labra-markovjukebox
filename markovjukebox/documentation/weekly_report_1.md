## Weekly Report 1


### What I've done this week?


I've been contemplating if my choice for subject is too demanding but the subject is what by far interests me the most
and my favourite courses so far have been TiRa I and II so I'm not too intimidated. I've been studying how Markov Chain and Trie 
data structure works related to generating new melodies. I feel like I have fairly good understanding how the problem should 
approached. At least theoretically.


### How program has progressed?


I set up all the developement tools for the project (maven, junit, jacoco, checkstyle, javadoc), so in the future
I can purely concentrate on the algorithm itself.


### What have I learned this week?


I've learned quite a lot about machine learning itself and the very basic idea of computational creativity or at least
one side of it. Of course I learned the very basic concept of approaching this kind of problem what I'm going to start 
working on.


### What was left unclear?


Nothing so far hasn't been overwhelming. What was left unclear was the practical implementation and relationship between
Markov Chains and Trie data structure. I know how the possibilities of next notes are represented as nodes in Trie tree, but are
the probabilities also stored in nodes? Is there multiple trees for different sequences? Very practical questions at the moment.
This could be done with matrixes as well, which is a bit easier concept to understand (for me) but I guess the problem would be
the efficiency..?


### What next?


I'm going figure out thoroughly how this acquired theory knowledge is implemented in practice and start the actual coding.
