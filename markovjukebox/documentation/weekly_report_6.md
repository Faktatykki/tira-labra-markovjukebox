## Weekly Report 6


### What have I done this week? / How program has progressed?

I created a simple UI to actually help testing stuff manually without changing the actual source code. Addition to that I did some 
more performance tests for Trie data structure. Need to do some tests for actual generation process.  
  
### What have I learned this week?  
  
I've learned that tempos in MIDI-files don't follow any rules when it comes to handling MIDI-files with jMusic library.  
  
### What was left unclear?  
  
Nothing really is unclear anymore when it comes to this project. Tempo problems seems to be more of a training set problem than nothing else. 

### What next?  

More tests, more performance tests. If I have time, I'll make the program to take multiple midi-files as a training set.
If I had more time I could make the program to take chords, time signatures and such in consideration.
