## Weekly Report 5


### What have I done this week? / How program has progressed?

Before these weeks only melody was generated with Markov chain and Trie, but I figured out a way (with a little hint from Hannu)  
to generate rhythm values, durations and dynamics too. I did some major refactoring so I could have really general
class for generation of different components, so that helped a lot too!  
  
### What have I learned this week?  
  
I learned how to generate rhythms, durations and dynamics using Markov chain and Trie. Addition to that I kind of know 
how to make note durations follow time signatures and even form chords, but I think that goes beyond this time window what
this course provides. We'll see.  
  
### What was left unclear?  
  
This jMusic library is a bit inconsistent regarding tempos, so I'll have to look into that.  

### What next?  

Finally it's time to make some proper performance tests and UI.
